"3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù @USER told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .@USERAhhh!SoTrumpplannedthemournfulprotestersattheUSEmbassyonNewYear‚ÄôsEve!",0

"Just to get this straight , according to Democrats , giving the Iranian terror regime access to hundreds of billions of dollars with no restrictions on terror use or ballistic missile testing was good , and killing the terrorist responsible for hundreds of American deaths is bad .@USER @USER Ben did .

"Funny how hustle porn rears up so aggressively during the literal one week a year that the US actually reliably treats as a holiday ? FUNNY ! Anyway here are some favorite things about rest :The "" 10,000 hours rule "" ( never a rule , decried by a thousand cognitive scientists , plucked from research to be cast into podcast-perpetual-pandering by Gladwell , Like He Does ) in original context actually talks about deliberate practice and * rest * cycles .Creativity research reliably documents the importance of deep rest , and that the people privileged to be able to live highly creative lives often have these deep rest cycles built in . Has been missed in research often but profoundly predictive of work outcomes when included .Rest is required for learning ( & forgetting is required for learning ! ) . Learning isn't just mashing more content into a bucket-brain forever . Lots of effects ( from deliberate practice to spacing ) show cram / work ' til you drop methods are inefficient , destructive in the longterm .Sleep is protective of long-term cognitive health in so many ways that it's up there with exercise and food as an absolute basic building block , not just of daily functioning , but of cognitive health in aging .@USERWellha!SiliconValleyfolkswillneverage.They'lljustdrinkbloodoftheunicorns,orbabiesorsomething.#hacksleep",1

"3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù @USER told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .@USERAhhh!SoTrumpplannedthemournfulprotestersattheUSEmbassyonNewYear‚ÄôsEve!",0

"When senior RBNY players complain about signing HGs or USL players all I read is "" I can't lead "" . Dudes were bailed out by an 18 - year-old in 2018 ( and 2017 ) and are not brave enough to discuss tactics in public .@USER Ok , I ‚Äô ll bite . 1 ) Which players in any team sport ‚Äú discuss tactics in public ? ‚Äù 2 ) team has made it plain what it thinks about leaders as it ‚Äô s sent the last 3 captains away . If team ethos is ‚Äú experience isn ‚Äô t valued , ‚Äù it ‚Äô s ok for experienced players to ask for a trade .@USER experienced is not valued ? Luis and BWP got new contracts after they were 30 . Club renewed Royer , Long , Parker , brought Rza . None is a baby . As for Kemar , he had the option not to sign the 2018 contract .@USER 1 ) oldest rostered player currently is 29 . 2 ) Kemar got raise before Long & Parker got PAID . Surely he feels he ‚Äô s worth more . 3 ) As he gets older , he becomes less attractive to a team looking to get younger all the time .@USER any player after 25 is an experienced one . Kemar can ask for more money , but to go after the club plans a year after he got a raise is bs . And to call the club unambitious when the players covering his back were renewed is just a lie .@USER Ambition is subjective . Look at the players brought in over the past 12 months .@USER what was the need for ‚Äú big ‚Äù signings after 18 ? Sure things didn ‚Äô t work as expected with Rza-Davis and CCJ replacing Adams . The BWP injury was unexpected , but they also underperformed . They are accountable .@USER In a league where if you're standing still , you're falling behind , standing pat isn't a recipe for success .@USER and I believe that has been acknowledge after 2019 . That doesn ‚Äô t mean the club has to raise the salary of a player who got a raise the year before , and is now using the obvious depth signings to absolve himself of any responsibility .@USER The core of your original argument is that Lawrence is saying ‚Äú I can ‚Äô t lead . ‚Äù I ‚Äô m challenging that . I agree 100 % with you that the team has no obligation to increase his salary a year after signing him .@USER@USERespeciallyonint'lduty.hisleadershipskillsmustbehorriblethere.",1

"@USER @USER @USER I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .@USER @USER @USER But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?@USER @USER @USER And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?@USER @USER @USER Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .@USER @USER @USER We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .@USER @USER @USER It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .@USER @USER @USER Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law .@USER @USER @USER It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .@USER @USER @USER It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc . <URL>@USER @USER @USER It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited .@USER The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .@USER @USER Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE .@USER @USER I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .@USER @USER Cars fail regularly as well . In fact AAA responded to 32 million calls for service in 2015 , and that's just ONE of the nation's roadside assistance providers . But you keep shining a light on your failure to provide an intelligent reason to discard rather than repair w / those gifs@USER @USER Maybe because I never said to discard it ü§∑ ‚Äç ‚ôÇ Ô∏è I merely showed that it fails .

"* huff , puff * Greetings , everyone ! Welcome to #SlateSpeak , your weekly progressive Christian chat . However , all are welcome , regardless of religion , or lack thereof . I am your host , and sorry I'm late . ( I was watching #JeopardyGOAT . ) ...... #SlateSpeak We don't always agree with other or the host , and that is ok : this is a safe place . We just ask you to please not troll . Now , for intros : name , pronouns , and one thing you hope for in the upcoming decade ( to do or to become ) ...#SlateSpeak ... while the intros are coming in , I'll start with prayer , but first note that my intro question is tied to our theme tonight : Lord God , thank you for bringing us to a new year and a new decade ! We ask for your guidance tonight ...#SlateSpeak ... and that we may be your instruments for peace and justice in the world . ( * now , please , conclude this prayer how you conclude it : I like to say , "" In Jesus ' name "" , but please say what you'd like ) Amen !#SlateSpeak ... Happy New Year , everyone ; I hope 2020 is going well in your personal lives , even if it got to a rough start . Not only is it a new year , but a new decade , and this brings us to our topic : new beginnings ! ...#SlateSpeak ... A smart aleck can dismiss this year / day as like any other and arbirary . However , rituals give space for expressing various emotions . For a new year , and particularly a new decade , it reflects our longings for new beginnings and for taking inventory ...#SlateSpeak ... I will follow @USER and start with scripture and say that God was , is , and is to come . ( Rev 4:8 ) Q1 : How do you see this verse tied to our theme ?#SlateSpeak ... Now , to the next question : Q2 : Which other scriptures do you see as tied to the theme of new beginnings , looking towards our future , etc . ?#SlateSpeak ... I think I'll go onto the next question : someone quoted "" In the beginning "" . I heard on a Jewish podcast that the verse can be read in Hebrew as "" With a beginning "" , meaning we can always have a new beginning ...#SlateSpeak ... I love that idea , and love the idea of being able to hit reset . However , as @USER notes , "" the past is incarnated in the present "" . Q3 : What things from the past are incarnated in the present and must be addressed if we are to have a new beginning ?#SlateSpeak ... @USER continues with her quote , "" The present gives birth to the future "" ( from the novel The Bastard of Istanbul [ CN for rape and genocide ] ) ...#SlateSpeak ... Q4 : As we discuss new beginnings and start a new decade , which steps ( small things included ) can we take to give birth to a good future , such that 2030 is better than 2020 ?@USERFeedhislambsTakecareofhissheepFeedhissheepFollowHim#SlateSpeak#Jesus",0
